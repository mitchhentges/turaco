** Version 1.0 - 2016/04/29
- Clear "Enter an expression" when a character is entered
- Show the current error in a single-line textbox on the bottom of the panel
- Fixed a case where StackOverflowError would be thrown on a short string, such as: `(B)*((B)*(B))*((B)*(B))`
    This is because BExprParser.nextOp() wasn't considering bracket depth

** Version 0.8 - 2003/06/07
- Finally got around to fixing the little annoying parsing bugs for expressions
  such as the following:
	!A
	!!A
	!(!A)
	(((A)))
	(A + B) + (C + D) <Note the extra spaces>

  Thanks to Hanh-Missi for pointing them out.
